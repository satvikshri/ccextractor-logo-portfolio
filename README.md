# CCExtractor Logos Portfolio
---

Hello, my name is Satvik Shrivastava. Thank you CCExtractor Development for encouraging desginers along with developers in this year's Google Code-In. This is my submission for the task of "Creating Organisation Logo".

I have created few designs, and have cherry picked some for the submission. 

1. This logo demostrate extracting Closed Captions from a video file. The zip on a video file is being opened to reveal closed captions. It's flat, simple and can be doubly used as icon for the GUI.

2. This is another simple logo, almost on the same concept. This actuay was the first mockup before building the above logo.
